# Landing-Page
TOP landing page project 

Date: 04/23/23

This is my first time creating something with so many boxes.
I recognize that TOP is not easy, even with all the self study and 
online resources this is something that is brand new to me. I started 
in January researching this stuff and april is when I chose to truly diving into it. Lets see what happens!

So far I have finally completed the skeleton and placement of everything on the page. Everything functions and works properly when minimized and expanded. My next goal is to personalize the page somehow by adding images and fun details. I work and do this on my spare time so hopefully by tomorrow I will have finished this. The topic of my page will be fitness. I already made almost 200 lines of code. I had no idea it would take so much work for such a simple page.
